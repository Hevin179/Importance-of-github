                                Why GitHub is Important
                                ------------------------

GitHub is a powerful platform used by developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.
It allows version control, so we can track changes made to our files over time. 
This makes it easy to work in teams and fix mistakes.

GitHub is especially useful for:
- Hosting projects publicly or privately
- Collaborating with other developers
- Showcasing work to potential employers
- Learning open-source contributions

Even for beginners like me, using GitHub helps develop professional habits and improves understanding of how real-world development works.
